# example

i'm testing this out 

what you have to do is 

to create the git, you need to 
git clone [url]
touch [file name]
git add [file name] . 
git push
git commit - 'message'


to edit you need to
delete folder off device
clone repository again (git clone [url])
vim '[file name]'
git add [file name] . 
git commit - 'message' but not neccessarily 
git push
